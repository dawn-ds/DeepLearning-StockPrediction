# DeepLearning-StockPrediction

Here we try to predict the value of stock prices of specific companies using deep learning algorithms using TensorFlow.
We test different types of networks based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units and compare the performance using cross validation.

The basic idea is borrowed from here: https://www.kaggle.com/fox10225fox/forked-predict-stock-price-with-lstm
